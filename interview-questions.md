# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is version control software which means it tracks changes, git is the software that GitHub runs on, while GitHub is an online platform for developers to upload, change and share code. 

Researched answer: Git is software that manages and tracks changes of your code, GitHub is an online service that lets you share, host and manage your code. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: True or false questions, honestly don't know, this is my guess

Researched answer: equal to, greater than and less than.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's value is the element that is housed within the arrayh while the index is the number of the order of each value. For example in the array ["24, "54', "89"] 24 is the value and 0 is the index. 

Researched answer: The index of a value is that value's location within the array, and the value is the element inside the array. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: strings are text, while arrays are collections of data. strings and arrays both have length and index functions. However, they are different data types in JavaScript. They cannot have the same built in methods. Strings output the text, to do it, you have to place the text within "". Arrays are collections of data, and can be very useful, the data is housed within the brackets []. Both can be assigned to a variable for ease. 

Researched answer: They cannot be used interchangeably because they are different data types and have different properties. Strings store text value and arrays can store data of all the different data types. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is collaborative coding, one person codes (Driver) while the other person guides the driver (Navigator) the driver is in charge of writing the code to the best of their ability, communicating with the navigator, and testing the code. The Navigator is in charge of telling the navigator what to code, communicating properly with the driver and looking out for typos or errors. With proper pair programming, the driver is sharing their screen and coding while the navigator is guiding the driver through the code they are working on. Both are paying attention and communicating frequently so as to avoid errors. 

Researched answer: The driver focuses on coding, while the navigator guides the driver, looks out for errors and checks code quality. The process starts by setting up a task, following the task and setting goals and folllowing those as well. They also switch according to the pomodoro method or when they need to. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: They are first-order-functions, they do at least one of these: can take one or more functions as arguments and can return a function as an output. 

2. Jest: a testing framework for JavaScript that ensures the JavaScript codebase is correct. 

3. Objects: it is a data type, it is used to store more complex things and collections.
